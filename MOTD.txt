=====Message of the Day======

UPDATE: Bug with Replicator and Test Run has been fixed

Welcome to OCTGN 3.1!
 
This new version now uses a proxy generator to create image-less cards on-the-fly. 
 
This means that you will be able to play the game without downloading any sets, but you will not see any images.

If you prefer to go back to the images, you can download the new .o8c files which contained the censored versions.

Do you want to open a browser page to the .o8c card pack downloads?
