Android:Netrunner LCG plugin for OCTGN
=========================
Android: Netrunner is an asymmetrical cyberpunk Card Game for two players made by Fantasy Flight Games. 

*Set in a dystopian, cyberpunk future where monolithic megacorps own and control the vast majority of human interests. While corporation players try to score points by advancing their agendas, they have to guard their intellectual properties from the elite and subversive hackers known as netrunners.*

This is a game definition for the [Online Card and Tabletop Gaming Network (OCTGN)](http://octgn.net). Its card effects are almost completely automated to allow for smoother play and prevent mistakes

Enjoy!
