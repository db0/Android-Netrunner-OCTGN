======New Version Information======

After popular demand, I've stopped automated exposing via opponents targeted card effects. 
This is to avoid mistakes from people rushing their actions without reading the pop-up warnings or checking with their opponent. 
Now the game will just announce the attempted expose, and the owner needs to do it manually.

Also various small bug fixes.

Have fun!
