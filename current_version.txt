2.1.2||
======New Version Information======

(2.1.2 includes the fix for the "Create New Server" bugging out. And Noise/Grimoire not working. Sorry about that)

More than a Trace Amount of updates! :)

The latest data pack is now live on OCTGN and it comes with a another hefty upgrade of systems.

:::IMPORTANT::: There's two significant changes other than the availability of the latest data pack.

1. Card can now be hosted properly on other cards. Cards which require a host will not be able to be played, unless you've targeted an appropriate host for them
This affects cards like Parasite and Personal Touch but on the background it also is working for Daemons like Djinn.

A hosted card will be trashed if its host ever leaves play. You don't need to do it manually anymore. 
This is important because now trashing a Djinn which hosts programs will trash all its hosted programs as well. Yes, this will also cascade on nested Djinns as it should ;)

2. There's a new function which allows the runner to access cards in a server. It's in the table menu under "Access Target".
You should use this after you've just had a successful run on a server and the Corp has passed on rezzing or triggering any abilities.

It will provide a function similar to the one when you access R&D or HQ, which will also automatically trigger abilities such as the Fetal AI, and require less actions from you.

-- So remember, once you succeed a run on a remote server, check if the Corp wants to rez anything, and if not, target all cards in the root of the server and "Access Target". --

Because of the scale of the updates to make the new set work, I'm forcing a set upgrade to 2.1.x. Patches have been provided as usual.
Happy Trace Dodging!
